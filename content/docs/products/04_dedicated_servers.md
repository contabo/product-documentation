# Dedicated Servers — Product Documentation

> **Product:** Dedicated Servers (Bare Metal)  
> **Category:** Compute

## Overview

Dedicated Servers — also referred to as Bare Metal — are single-tenant physical machines where every resource (CPU, RAM, storage, and network) belongs exclusively to one customer. There are no shared hypervisors, no neighboring tenants, and no resource contention. You either run the OS directly on the hardware or install your own hypervisor (Proxmox, KVM, VMware) to create your own virtualized environment.

Contabo's Dedicated Server lineup includes AMD Ryzen consumer-grade, AMD EPYC Genoa, and the latest AMD EPYC Turin (9th gen) processors. AMD EPYC Turin processors deliver 17% better instructions-per-clock compared to the previous Genoa generation. Outlet Servers (discounted refurbished configurations) are also available.

## Ideal Use Cases

- High-traffic websites and large-scale e-commerce platforms
- Production databases with heavy transaction volumes (OLTP, data warehouses)
- AI/ML model training requiring full GPU access
- Self-managed hypervisor environments (Proxmox, VMware ESXi, KVM)
- Game servers requiring stable, low-latency performance
- Crypto mining operations
- Applications with strict data isolation or compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Reseller hosting with full hardware control
- Rendering farms and computationally intensive media processing
