# Cloud VDS — Product Documentation

> **Product:** Cloud VDS (Virtual Dedicated Servers)  
> **Category:** Compute  
> **URL:** contabo.com/en/vds/  
> **Source:** contabo.com | **Last updated:** June 2026

---

## Overview

Cloud VDS occupies the performance tier between Cloud VPS and fully bare-metal Dedicated Servers. The defining difference from VPS is that every VDS instance runs on **dedicated physical CPU cores** — not shared virtual cores. This means neighboring tenants on the same host cannot cause performance degradation ("noisy neighbor" problem). RAM is also 100% reserved. VDS plans are ideal for workloads that need predictable, consistent compute without the cost and management overhead of a full bare-metal server.

---

## Ideal Use Cases

- Production databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) under sustained load
- CPU-intensive backend services and APIs
- Video encoding and transcoding pipelines
- Machine learning inference workloads
- High-frequency trading bots requiring consistent latency
- High-traffic web applications with unpredictable CPU spikes
- Self-hosted hypervisors (Proxmox, KVM, Hyper-V) and virtual machine hosting
- Applications requiring guaranteed compute free from shared-resource contention

## Plans

| Model | Physical CPU Cores | CPU Model | RAM | NVMe Storage | Network Port | Traffic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cloud VDS S | 3 cores | AMD EPYC 7282, 2.8 GHz | 24 GB | 180 GB NVMe | 250 Mbit/s | Unlimited* |
| Cloud VDS M | 4 cores | AMD EPYC 7282, 2.8 GHz | 32 GB | 240 GB NVMe | 500 Mbit/s | Unlimited* |
| Cloud VDS L | 6 cores | AMD EPYC 7282, 2.8 GHz | 48 GB | 360 GB NVMe | 750 Mbit/s | Unlimited* |
| Cloud VDS XL | 8 cores | AMD EPYC 7282, 2.8 GHz | 64 GB | 480 GB NVMe | 1 Gbit/s | Unlimited* |
| Cloud VDS XXL | 12 cores | AMD EPYC 7282, 2.8 GHz | 96 GB | 720 GB NVMe | 1 Gbit/s | Unlimited* |

> Additional NVMe storage configurations are available beyond the base amounts listed above.  
> \* Incoming traffic: unlimited and unmetered. Outgoing: fair usage policy applies. Contabo reserves the right to throttle servers with exceptionally high or disruptive usage.

## Limitations & Notes

- CPU cores are dedicated **physical** cores, but the host machine is still multi-tenant at the hardware level — only cores and RAM are exclusively reserved.
- Storage changes (type or capacity) require a server reinstall — back up data before requesting.
- Windows Server incurs an additional monthly license fee.
- IPMI / KVM-over-IP remote management is not available — use the Control Panel VNC console or SSH.
- VDS supports nested virtualization (Proxmox, KVM, Hyper-V); Cloud VPS does not.
