# Storage VPS — Product Documentation

> **Product:** Storage VPS  
> **Category:** Compute / Storage  
> **URL:** contabo.com/en/storage-vps/

## Overview

Storage VPS plans are purpose-built for workloads that require large amounts of affordable SSD storage inside a full virtual machine. Unlike Object Storage (which is accessed via API), Storage VPS gives you a complete Linux or Windows environment with root access and a large SSD block device — ideal for high-capacity workloads that don't demand extreme I/O speed. All plans include unlimited traffic and are priced competitively against equivalent Cloud VPS tiers, with the storage-to-price ratio as the primary differentiator.

**Storage VPS 20 carries the "Unbeatable Value" badge on Contabo's website**, delivering 400 GB SSD, 3 vCPUs, and 8 GB RAM.

## Ideal Use Cases

- Backups and disaster recovery (database dumps, server snapshots, archive files)
- Self-hosted Nextcloud file storage
- Block storage alternative (full VM with large disk pool)
- Cold archiving of infrequently accessed data
- Log aggregation and long-term log retention
- Data repositories for analytics pipelines
- FTP/SFTP file servers
- Media asset storage (photos, video files)

## Limitations & Notes

- Storage type is SSD, **not NVMe** — suitable for high-capacity use cases, not for extreme I/O throughput workloads (use Cloud VPS with NVMe for that).
- Upgrading to a different storage plan requires a server reinstall — back up data first.
- Changing storage type also requires a reinstall and full data backup.
- Additional SSD storage beyond the plan's base can be added via Control Panel (Cloud VPS process); VDS/Dedicated customers must contact support.
- Windows Server incurs an additional monthly license fee.
