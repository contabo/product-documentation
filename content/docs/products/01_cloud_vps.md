## Overview

Cloud VPS is Contabo's flagship product and the entry point for most customers. These are KVM-based virtualized servers with dedicated resource allocations — offering shared vCPU cores, generous RAM, and a choice between Gen 4 PCIe NVMe or standard SSD storage. The entire lineup was redesigned in May 2025 to deliver more performance per euro than any comparable offering on the market.

**Cloud VPS 20 is Contabo's most popular plan**, offering 6 vCPUs, 12 GB RAM, and 100 GB NVMe.
